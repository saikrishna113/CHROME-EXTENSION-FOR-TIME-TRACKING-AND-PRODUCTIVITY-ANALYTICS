I'll create a visual representation of the Chrome extension interface to show you what the productivity tracker would look like.I've created a complete visual demo of the ProductivityTracker Chrome extension! Here's what you can see in the output:

## **Left Side - Chrome Extension Popup:**
- **Real-time tracking status** with animated indicator
- **Current session info** showing active website and time spent
- **Today's productivity summary** with visual progress bar
- **Top visited sites** with category labels (productive/unproductive)
- **Quick action buttons** for dashboard and data management

## **Right Side - Analytics Dashboard:**
- **Overview statistics** showing total time, productivity score, and weekly metrics
- **Interactive time filters** (Today, This Week, This Month, All Time)
- **Weekly productivity trend chart** comparing productive vs unproductive hours
- **Category breakdown pie chart** showing time distribution across different activities
- **Detailed weekly report** with top websites, visit counts, and progress indicators

## **Key Features Demonstrated:**

1. **Smart Categorization**: Websites are automatically classified as:
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Productive** (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Google Docs) - Green indicators
   - ðŸ”´ **Unproductive** (YouTube, Social Media) - Red indicators
